# SpotifyGroups
A web app that allows its users to form groups with one another and share music preferences. Live version can be found here: https://spotify-groups.herokuapp.com/ 

## Why I made it

I started this project around late February. The backstory to this project was that I really wanted to share music with my sister, but I found that when we texted songs to each other, most of the time I never actually listened to it. By creating groups, users can see what their group members are listening to and generate a playlist with every users combined tastes. Another reason why I created this was because Spotify does not have a lyrics function where you can view the lyrics to a song, and Genius only supports Apple Music, so I wanted to create a feature where you could listen to a song and view the lyrics at the same, without having to switch tabs and what not.

Here they can see the groups they are apart of, any group invitations they have received, and their own personal playlist generated based off their music preferences.

You must have a Spotify Premium Account to use this feature as it plays the song in the browser. You can search for any song and if that song has lyrics on Genius, it'll display them. You can use the mini music player to traverse the song.

You can view your top artists or songs in the past 4 weeks, 6 months, or all time.

## Future Updates

I'm probably done working on this project for now. Maybe in the future, I'll add some other things like a Playlist Builder, but for now, I want to work on some other projects. I don't plan on profiting off this in any way, shape, or form. I built this project purely for the learning experience and my desire to share music with my sister and also sing along to songs.
