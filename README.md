# SpotifyGroups
A web app that allows its users to form groups with one another and share music preferences. Live version can be found here: https://spotify-groups.herokuapp.com/ 

## Why I made it

I started this project around late February. The backstory to this project was that I really wanted to share music with my sister, but I found that when we texted songs to each other, most of the time I never actually listened to it. By creating groups, users can see what their group members are listening to and generate a playlist with every users combined tastes. Another reason why I created this was because Spotify does not have a lyrics function where you can view the lyrics to a song, and Genius only supports Apple Music, so I wanted to create a feature where you could listen to a song and view the lyrics at the same, without having to switch tabs and what not. 

## Future Updates

I'm probably done working on this project for now. Maybe in the future, I'll add some other things like a Playlist Builder, but for now, I want to work on some other projects. I don't plan on profiting off this in any way, shape, or form. I built this project purely for the learning experience and my desire to share music with my sister and also sing along to songs.
